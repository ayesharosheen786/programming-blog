        <h1>COMMON TAGS</h1>
        <p>The  html element is the root element of an HTML page
            The head element contains meta information about the HTML page
            The title element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
            The body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            The h1 element defines a large heading
            The p element defines a paragraph
            </p>
            <h1>HTML HEADINGS</h1>
            <p>HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
                HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags.
                h1- is the largest heading tag and h6 is smallest.</p>
                    <h1>HTML PARAGRAPHS</h1>
                    <p>The HTML p- element defines a paragraph.
                        A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
                        The HTML br- element defines a line break.
                        Use br if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
                        </p>

                            Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.
The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:
       
                        </p>
