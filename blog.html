        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language used to create webpages.
            <br>
            HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, published in 1995 as HTML 2.0.
 HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML. 
HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers.
        </p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheet and it is used to design HTML documents
            <br>
            CSS was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.

        </p>
        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <p>JAVASCRIPT is object based scripting language
            <br>
            avaScript is everywhere, and for the seventh year in a row, it has been ranked the most commonly used programming language, with 67.8% of developers employing it in 2019. Its ascent to the world’s most popular programming language is synonymous with the rise of the internet itself.

Created out of necessity, it is used to build 95.2% (1.52 billion) of websites today, including some of the world’s largest, like Facebook and YouTube. Without it, we would not have popular and useful web apps such as Google Maps and eBay. 

So, without further ado, let’s take a look at what JavaScript is,  how and why it was created, and what’s next for the language.
        </p>
        <h2>PYTHON</h2>
        <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 
            <br>
            Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.
